# GDServ
Geometry Dash Private Server

### You're advised that this is still a work in progress and codebase might change at some point

## How to run
- If you don't have installed Node.JS install it now from this link: [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Node.JS Download")
- Be sure to modify etc/config.inc.json with the correct endpoints that you actually need
- Once installed, install nodemon by opening a terminal and writing: `npm install -g nodemon`
- Once completed, close that terminal and open a new one on the folder where gdserv.js is
- Execute `npm run dev`

Following those steps will open a local server on port 80 where you can do your tests and such
## Features working
- Login
- Registration

It ain't much at this time but i'll update with advances and so on.

Please open a issue if you have a question or a pull request if you want to contribute to the code! :D
